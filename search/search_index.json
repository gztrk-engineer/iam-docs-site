An element aggregates properties from all matching rulesets. As the element matches all example rulesets, it will have all properties: <code>backgroundColor</code>, <code>tintColor</code>, and <code>font</code>. Count the tags. If multiple ruleset matches contain the same property (different values), the match with more tags prevails. Rulesets 1 and 2 have the same property: <code>backgroundColor</code>, but ruleset 2 includes more tags. Therefore, the element will use the property from ruleset 2: (<code>\"backgroundColor\": { \"hex\": \"#0000ff\" }</code>). The order matters. If an element matches multiple rulesets with the same number of tags, the last declared ruleset is applied. Rulesets 2 and 3 include the same property (<code>font</code>) and the same number of tags (two). In this case, the last declared matching ruleset is applied (<code>\"font\": {\"fontWeight\": \"50px\"}</code>)."},{"location":"Other-Topics/personalize-app/stylesheet-spec/#stylesheet-example","title":"Stylesheet example","text":"<p>Simplified stylesheet example: </p> <pre><code>{\n    // All styles must be specified inside the 'styles' object\n    \"styles\": [\n        {  \n            // An example ruleset may include one or more tag values (string). \n            \"rule\": {\n                // All tags must match the element for the ruleset to be applied. \n                \"tags\": [ \"list-item\", \"info-screen\" ]\n            },\n            // If an element matches all tags from a ruleset, the app applies specified properties. \n            \"properties\": {\n                \"backgroundColor\": { \"hex\": \"#00dddd\" },\n                \"tintColor\": { \"hex\": \"#ffffff\" }\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"rule\": {\n                \"tags\": [ \"list-item\", \"hover\" ]\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n                // The subtype 'ref' indicates a style variable. \n                \"backgroundColor\": { \"ref\": \"primary_color\" }\n            }\n        },\n\n        {\n            // This is how images are specified.
